Easy Explore plug-in (http://sourceforge.net/projects/easystruts/files/Easy%20Explorer%20for%20Eclipse/easy-explore-1.0.4/)

Easy Explorer is a very useful plug in, Which helps you to browse resources with the native Operating system explorer. In the Eclipse, select a file, right-mouse click, and select the 'Easy Explore...'

Thanks the original author's great work. As this plug-in have no update now, but I want it work in Ubuntu And Mac OS, I make some change base on it's open source code. 

## *Notice

My current release(1.0.4.u01) is not a best effective release, as I used "nautilus" tool in native OS, it will fail if your env have no this tool.


## How to use it.


Download the release jar([Download](https://github.com/houdejun214/EasyExplore/releases/download/1.0.4.u01/org.sf.easyexplore_1.0.4.u01.jar)) and put it in the plugins folder of eclipse
