Easy Explore plug-in (http://sourceforge.net/projects/easystruts/files/Easy%20Explorer%20for%20Eclipse/easy-explore-1.0.4/)

Easy Explorer is a very useful plug in, Which helps you to browse resources with the native Operating system explorer. In the Eclipse, select a file, right-mouse click, and select the 'Easy Explore...'

Thanks the original author's great work. As this plug-in have no update now, but I want it work in Ubuntu And Mac OS, I make some change base on it's open source code.
